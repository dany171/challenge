# Challenge

This is a simple app result of the implementation of the challenge requested in the process.

- I've uploaded Spoonacular API key in order to do not need to sent it to you through a different channel and ease the installation.
- As spoken I'm styding Clean Architecture and I found this project as a good opportunity use it as practice.
- The app also uses modern Android development libraries, some of them like Compose are kind of new to me.
- Unit test are included however no UI tests so far
- Known issue: I tried to implement an offline list support, however it's not working as some work is pending to search in offline, however as it's not part of the scope of the project I decided to left it as is.
